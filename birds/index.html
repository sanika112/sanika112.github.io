Ostriches are the fastest running birds in the world!</p>

        <h3>What is the world's smartest bird?</h3>

        <p>The New Zealand Kea, the world's only alpine parrot is known as the 'Clown of the Alps' to South Islanders; and has recently been heralded as the world's smartest bird (its intelligence rivals a monkey's) says the Institute of Cognitive Biology in Vienna.  Keas are known to be able to reach a lifespan of more than 50 years when kept in captivity. However, since it is now illegal to keep them as pets due to their endangered status, Keas are very unlikely to be found in captivity except for those that are purposely kept to conserve the numbers of these birds.</p>

    <h3>The 4 Hogwarts Houses</h3>

    <p>There are also 4 houses of Hogwarts. There's Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. These houses were named after wonderful witches and wizards.</p>

    <p>To be in Gryffindor, it means bravery, and boldness.</p>

    <p>Slytherin means ambitious, cunning, and resourceful. But people think Slytherin is bad because of Voldemort. In my opinion, I think the people <u>WHO</u> are in Slytherin is bad. Not the house.</p>

    <p>Hufflepuff is where you will find the most trustworthy and hardworking students. In fact, out of all the houses Hufflepuff has produced the least number of dark witches and wizards.</p>

    <p>Ravenclaws are known for their wisdom, cleverness, and wit ( keen intelligence).</p>

    <h3>About Harry Potter</h3>

    <p>Harry Potter, a boy who learns on his eleventh birthday that he is the orphaned son of two powerful wizards and possesses unique magical powers of his own. He is summoned from his life as an unwanted child to become a student at Hogwarts, an English boarding school for wizards. There, he meets several friends who become his closest allies and help him discover the truth about his parents' mysterious deaths.</p>

    <h3>About Ron Weasley</h3>

    <p>Personality… a bit lazy and (at times) hot-headed, but also funny and intensely loyal. Ron is everything Harry could ask for in a best friend/sidekick, and he never hesitates to join Harry on a risky adventure. Though he might get jealous of Harry's fame and fortune, Ron never fails to support him. Ron's also scared of spiders.</p>

    <h3>About Hermione Granger</h3>

    <h3>About Draco Malfoy</h3>

    <p>Draco Malfoy was a British pure-blood wizard and the only son of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. The son of a Death Eater, Draco was raised to strongly believe in the importance of blood purity. He looked down on half-bloods and Muggle-borns. Draco may seem like the kind of child who, considering his parents, would have been born with darkness in him, but he showed us that it wasn't his bloodline or some kind of predisposition to wrongdoing that is the problem, but instead, the bad choices that we make can be. He was essentially a good person with a terrible personality</p>

    <h3>About Lord Voldemort (You Know Who)</h3>

    <p>Voldemort is the archenemy of Harry Potter, who according to a prophecy has "the power to vanquish the Dark Lord". He attempts to murder the boy, but instead kills his parents, Lily and James Potter, and leaves Harry with a scar on his forehead in the shape of a lightning bolt. People didn't say his name because of this: A spell was used during the Second Wizarding War. During the said war, saying Voldemort's name was made Taboo and therefore used as a means of capturing members of the Order of the Phoenix, whom the Death Eaters believed to be the only ones who dared to speak it.</p>

    <h3>About Voldemort's Death Eaters</h3>
